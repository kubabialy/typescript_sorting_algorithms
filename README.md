# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of some of the sorting algorithms written in TypeScript.

It might not be a perfect implementation but it should at least give you an idea of how a certain algorithm works.

Credits for documentation should go to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org)

## Notes

Many sorting algorithms are often available 'natively' in your language of choice. Unless there's a particular and valid reason for you to write your own implementation of a sorting algorithm I strongly recommend sticking to already available implementations.

Important note: Explicit return of the values in the implementations is done purposefully for those who are less familiar with JS/TS and its way of handling referenced values
## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. If you want to add new algorthms just add some simple tests and fairly understandable implementation for others to go through.
