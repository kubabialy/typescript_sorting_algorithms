# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of some sorting algorithms written in TypeScript.

It might not be a perfect implementation, but it should at least give you an idea of how a certain algorithm works.

Credits for a documentation should go to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org)

## Notes

Many sorting algorithms are often available 'natively' in your language of choice. Unless there's a particular and valid reason for you to write your own implementation of a sorting algorithm I strongly recommend sticking to already available implementations.

Important note: Explicit return of the values in the implementations is done purposefully for those who are less familiar with JS/TS and its way of handling referenced values

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. If you want to add new algorithms just add some simple tests and fairly understandable implementation for others to go through.
